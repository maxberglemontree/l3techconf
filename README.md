# l3techconf
Repo for demonstrating basic Kubernetes usage

### Requirements
You must be able to run `snap`.

Then, run `snap install microk8s`. You may be required to add a flag: `snap install microk8s --classic`

Once the installation is complete, test the installation by running a command such as `microk8s kubectl get ns`. You should see a list of namespaces created by microk8s.
